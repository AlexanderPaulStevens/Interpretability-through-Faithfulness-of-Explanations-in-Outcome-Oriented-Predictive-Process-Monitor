# Interpretability through Faithfulness of Explanations in Outcome-Oriented Predictive Process Monitoring
Current work of Interpretability in Outcome-Oriented Predictive Process Monitoring.

An overview of the files:


### Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Selection
-EDA_FeatureSelection

### Hyperoptimalisation of parameters
- Hyperopt_LogitLeafModel
- Hyperopt_MachineLearningModels

### Training of the Machine Learning Models
- Experiment_BPIC2017
- Experiment_TF1
- Experiment_BPIC2015

### Training of the Deep Learning Models
- LSTM_BPIC2017
- LSTM_TF1
- LSTM_BPIC2015


The preprocessing and hyperoptimalisation are based on the code provided by https://github.com/irhete/predictive-monitoring-benchmark. 
 We would like to thank the authors for the high quality code that allowed to fastly reproduce the provided work.
Secondly, we acknowledgde the work provided by https://github.com/renuka98/interpretable_predictive_processmodel architecture to create the long short-term neural networks with attention layers visualisations.
